# 8puzzle
An artificial intelligence program that finds the step by step solution to an 8-puzzle. It starts with an initial state and the program determines whether the initial state is solvable or not depending on the number of inversions. The goal state for this 8-puzzle looks like this:

[1 2 3]  
[8 0 4]  
[7 6 5]  

The initial state can be changed in the python file. Note that the empty space in the 8-puzzle is represented by the number 0.
